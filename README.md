ToolExchange is a web application designed to allow community members to share and loan tools among themselves by creating community and personal sheds. The project requires Python 3 and Django 1.5 to run. It was created for SWEN-261 at RIT by Kevin Moses, Yura Kim, Johnathan Sellers, Brian Lovelace, and Allan Piazzarollo.
